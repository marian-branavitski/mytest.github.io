		<h3>Something about Crush 40:</h3>
		<p>Crush 40 is a Japanese-American hard rock band. The group consists of
		guitarist and composer Jun Senoue and vocalist Johnny Gioeli, although 
		Senoue has featured other lead vocalists on a Crush 40 album. Crush 40 
		is best known for their contributions to the Sonic the Hedgehog video 
		game series. Senoue is employed by Sega as a composer and sound director, 
		and has worked with Sega as a composer since 1993. While preparing music 
		for Sonic Adventure, he contacted Gioeli to record the game's title track, 
		"Open Your Heart". They also recorded the soundtrack for NASCAR Arcade under
		the name "Sons of Angels" and released it in 2000 in Japan as the album 
		Thrill of the Feel. Afterward, Senoue and Gioeli stayed in contact and 
		continued to record new music for further Sonic games, as well as their own 
		original music, and performed live concerts.</p>
